        <p>Early in the new year, Walmart and Google announced a partnership that could shake up commerce as we know it. Social commerce has reached an all-time high, with consumers having access to a range of online stores, including TikTok Shop, Amazon, and Meta’s shopping platforms (Facebook and Instagram). On that note, cue Walmart and Google. These two mega companies in their respective industries have begun a partnership that will turn your computer into a digital personal shopper that does the work for you by entering the agentic commerce space (via Agentic AI).
Agentic commerce (powered by agentic AI) has made significant advancements, with Google and Walmart partnering to embed shopping and checkout directly within Gemini. That’s right, Walmart’s entire inventory is being integrated into Google’s AI platform. Imagine being on your PC and telling Gemini, “I need to host a watch party for the game this weekend.” Instead of just giving you a list of websites to click on, the AI finds the chips and drinks at Walmart, applies your discounts, and lets you check out right inside the chat window. This is a surefire game-changer in the e-commerce industry, as consumers gain a “digital sales associate” to order their products, freeing them from the time-consuming trips to stores or endless scrolling on the Walmart app.

       <!-- <h2>Customer experience as product</h2>
        <p>Today the product is not just what you buy — it's how you discover, customize, and receive it. Stores and platforms that succeed treat discovery and delivery as first-class product features.</p>

        <h2>Supply & flow</h2>
        <p>Inventory becomes a fluid system when visibility, orchestration, and agent-assisted decisioning reduce friction between demand and supply.</p>

        <h2>What comes next</h2>
        <p>Expect tighter coordination between intent signals and fulfillment, richer personal experiences, and an increased role for agentic systems that can act on behalf of customers and businesses.</p> -->
