        <p>Retail is changing. The interplay of digital experiences, logistics optimization, and adaptive agentic systems is remaking how customers discover and receive value.</p>

        <h2>Customer experience as product</h2>
        <p>Today the product is not just what you buy — it's how you discover, customize, and receive it. Stores and platforms that succeed treat discovery and delivery as first-class product features.</p>

        <h2>Supply & flow</h2>
        <p>Inventory becomes a fluid system when visibility, orchestration, and agent-assisted decisioning reduce friction between demand and supply.</p>

        <h2>What comes next</h2>
        <p>Expect tighter coordination between intent signals and fulfillment, richer personal experiences, and an increased role for agentic systems that can act on behalf of customers and businesses.</p>
