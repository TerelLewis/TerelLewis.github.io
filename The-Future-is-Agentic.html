        <p>According to a groundbreaking Gartner report released on January 15, 2026, we are witnessing a fundamental shift in how businesses connect with their customers. The traditional model of managing separate email, web, and social campaigns is being phased out in favor of agentic AI—autonomous systems that don’t just “assist” but actually act on a user’s behalf. As Emily Weiss, senior principal researcher at Gartner, stated, “This marks the end of channel-based marketing as we know it.” To succeed, brands must move beyond siloed email or social campaigns and integrate AI agents that operate continuously across marketing, sales, and support. This evolution requires a complete rethink of data governance and a shift to weekly journey tracking to keep pace with the “unprecedented speed” of AI-driven interactions.positioned as agentic experiences proliferate.</p>
        <p>As AI-generated content becomes more prevalent, trust has emerged as the industry’s most valuable asset. Gartner found that 78% of consumers view clear labeling of AI content as essential for maintaining trust. Consequently, by 2027, brands will allocate 50% of influencer marketing budgets toward initiatives focused on authenticity, such as identity verification and safeguards against deepfakes. The introduction of agentic AI is important, especially for organizations, because this isn’t just a “tech upgrade”—it’s a total overhaul of the marketing operating model. To succeed, Gartner notes that brands will need “stronger data governance” and “greater transparency” regarding how customer data is used. Those who fail to adapt to this emerging technology risk losing control over their personalization efforts and, ultimately, the trust of their customers. </p>
